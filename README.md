`HOW TO MAKE YOU OWN BOT WITH THIS CODE`

- Click the `New Application` button and go through the whole creation process

`2)` Go to the `Bot` tab and click `Add Bot`, click the `Yes, Do It!` button
- Then press `Reset Token`
- Copy the token and store it somewhere safe, ***DO NOT LET ANYONE ELSE SEE IT*** (they could get access to your bot with it)

`3)` Go [***here***](https://nodejs.org)
- Press one of the green download buttons (I recommend the one on the left)

- Then click the `Copy` button under GENERATED URL

`5)` Paste the URL into your address bar

`6)` Go into the server you installed it into and copy the bot's ID
	
`7)` Press the `<> Code` button on this site
- Select either `Clone` (if you want to make your own Github repo) or `Download Zip` (to have it just on your computer)

`8)` Unzip and open up the code on your computer
- Drag all of the files inside of the `Inbotigator-main` folder out so they aren't inside of it
- Delete `Inbotigator-main`

`9)` Click on `src`, then `functions`
- Go into the `handleCommands` file
- Find the part where it says: `const clientId = "1046189896311775272";`
- Replace `1046189896311775272` with the bot ID you copied earlier
- Press Ctrl+S to save

`9)` Create a new file named `.env` in the general explorer
- In the `.env` file write: `token=<TOKEN>` (substitute `<TOKEN>` for the token you copied earlier)
- And Ctrl+S again

`10)` Press the `Terminal` button on the top left
- Click `New Terminal`

`11)` Click on the text box that appeared on the bottom
